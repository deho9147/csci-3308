1. IaaS is scable but you can only dev from only one spot at a time. It is difficult to move infrastructure models. 
PasS is useful when multiple developers are working on a single application. It works well for automated testing
and deployment. A scenario IaaS would be better than PaaS is an application that needs to be scaled to users
but you don't want to deal with multiple devs. 


2. Data breaches are a security concern because people can get access to valuble information of people 
that can lead to very messy situations that are hard to solve. 


3. Software and apps shouldn't migrate to the cloud if they are very prone to secuirty attacks. A software that 
does not scale and is for personal use should not be on the cloud as it just adds uneccessary cost.
